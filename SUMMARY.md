# Elysian Realm - Fullstack Admin Panel

## Summary

We've successfully created a fullstack admin panel application with the following features:

### Backend (ElysiaJS + Bun)
- User authentication with JWT tokens
- Role-based access control (RBAC) system
- User, role, and permission management APIs
- Prisma ORM integration with PostgreSQL
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Middleware for authentication and authorization
- Full TypeScript type safety with proper JWT plugin integration
- OpenTelemetry integration for distributed tracing
- Dockerized deployment with health checks

### Frontend (React + Vite + TailwindCSS)
- Responsive admin dashboard
- User management interface
- Role management interface
- Login page with form validation
- Navigation between different sections
- Dockerized deployment with Nginx

### How to Run the Application

You can run this application in two ways: using Docker (recommended) or manually installing dependencies.

#### Docker Setup (Recommended)
```bash
# Start all services with Docker Compose (production)
docker-compose up --build

# For development with hot reloading:
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
```

The Docker setup includes:
- PostgreSQL database
- Jaeger for distributed tracing
- Backend API service
- Frontend service served by Nginx

#### Manual Setup

1. **Backend Setup**
   ```bash
   # Install dependencies
   bun install
   
   # Set up PostgreSQL database
   # Update DATABASE_URL in .env file
   
   # Run migrations
   bunx prisma migrate dev --name init
   
   # Seed database
   bunx prisma db seed
   
   # Start backend server
   bun run src/index.ts
   ```

2. **Frontend Setup**
   ```bash
   # Navigate to client directory
   cd client
   
   # Install dependencies
   bun install
   
   # Start frontend development server
   bun run dev
   ```

### Technologies Used

- **Backend**: ElysiaJS, Bun, Prisma, PostgreSQL, JWT
- **Frontend**: React, Vite, TailwindCSS v4, TypeScript
- **Security**: bcrypt for password hashing, JWT for authentication
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Deployment**: Docker, Docker Compose, Nginx
- **Monitoring**: Jaeger for distributed tracing
- **Configuration**: Centralized configuration management

### Next Steps

To fully deploy this application, you would need to:

1. Set up a PostgreSQL database (locally or with a cloud provider)
2. Configure environment variables for production
3. Use the provided Docker Compose setup for easy deployment
4. Set up proper SSL certificates for production use
5. Add additional security measures like rate limiting and input validation
6. Configure monitoring and logging for production
7. Consider adding a reverse proxy (e.g., Traefik, Nginx) for production deployments
8. Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment
9. Customize Tailwind CSS theme and add additional styling as needed
